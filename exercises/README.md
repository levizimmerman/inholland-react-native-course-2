## General Submission Guidelines

For all exercises:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your project
2. **Commit your code** after completing each exercise
3. **Write clear commit messages** describing what you implemented
4. **Test your app** ideally on both iOS and Android.
5. **Push your code to GitHub** and share the repository with [me via Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/48:notes/conversations?context=%7B%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D).

## Helpful Commands

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues
If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18+)
2. Try `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache
3. Restart your terminal and try again
4. Check the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)
5. Ask your instructor for help!

### Exercise-Specific Troubleshooting

**Exercise 1 (TanStack Query):**
- **Import errors**: Make sure your TypeScript paths are configured correctly in `tsconfig.json`
- **Network errors**: Check your internet connection and API availability
- **Caching issues**: Clear your app data or restart the development server
- **Type errors**: Ensure all imports are correct and types are properly defined

**Exercise 2 (Navigation):**
- **Route not found**: Make sure your `[name].tsx` file is in the correct directory
- **Image not loading**: Check your internet connection and image URL
- **Navigation issues**: Verify the route path matches your file structure

**Exercise 3 (Database):**
- **Database not initialized**: Make sure to call `initDatabase()` in your app layout
- **SQLite errors**: Check that all database operations are properly awaited
- **Query not updating**: Ensure you're invalidating the correct query keys
- **Import errors**: Verify all file paths and imports are correct

Good luck with your Pokedex app! ðŸš€
